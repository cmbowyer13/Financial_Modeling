    "## K seems arbitary, but as an example k = 10% = 0.1 is acceptable (This could be estimated as well from historical data -- is this the year over year appreciation on the stock price?) G on the other hand can be estimated from previous history of dividend payments by a company to arrive at accurate dividend for next year. Once G is estimated properly it could be applied to the current Dividend given our in the current year to estimate next year's dividend payout. I will now apply these ideas to a few current companies and see if they are undervalued or overvalued. I will take Eli Lilly as example to check if the company is currently overvalued or undervalued.
